## Disclaimer:
- Please contact me if you would like to utilize this code. The repository is not designed as a tool but as an effort of open science to share the code utilized in this publication. Several libraries need to be installed manually as well as orthology tables generated.

## Ongoing
- [ ] add google drive link to large start phenotype dataset.
